## Idea
  
   In the winter of Glasgow, Our team found roads always icy and slippery. Some people slip on roads because of ice and snow. So we decided to construct a system to prevent these accidents.
  
## Target of this project  
  
  This project aims to prevent the formation of ice or snow by using brine as the anti-icing agent. Utilising the humidity and temperature sensor to detect the environmental conditions, the sprinkler spreads the brine water which is controlled by Raspberry Pi. IR sensor is used to detect people and animals. When it detects people, the sprinkler turn off.
