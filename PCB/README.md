## PCB description  
  
  ### PCB Artwork  
   PCB Artwork in the circuit designing process refers to the planning and placing of electrical traces and via holes to connect every component mounted on the board with each other.  
   PCB Artwork rules/guidelines is used as a base for the circuit design to facilitate a standard design and manufacturing procedures.

  ### Pdf files of PCB
   We designed two PCBs, one for sensors, another one for Motor driver.
   Each PCB has two layers. 
   #### Circuit of Sensors
   these files named as ``` Sensor top1.pdf ``` and ``` Sensor botom1.pdf ```  
   #### Circuit of motor
   These files named as ```Motor Bottom new``` ```Motor Top new```   
    
  ### Schematic  
  the circuit is shown in the file named ``` sensors.opj ```
  It can be opened by ``` Orcad Capture ```.
