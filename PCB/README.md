## PCB description  
  
  ### PCB Artwork  
   PCB Artwork in the circuit designing process refers to the planning and placing of electrical traces and via holes to connect every component mounted on the board with each other.  
   PCB Artwork rules/guidelines is used as a base for the circuit design to facilitate a standard design and manufacturing procedures.

  ### Pdf files of PCB  
   This PCB has two layers, therefore we need two pdf files.  
   these files named as ``` newtop1.pdf ``` and ``` nwebotom1.pdf ```
    
  ### Schematic  
  the circuit is shown in the file named ``` sensors.opj ```
  It can be opened by ``` Orcad Capture ```.
