## Sensors  
###Humidity and Temperature sensor:   
we choose DHT22 with one signal output.  
- Low cost  
- 3 to 5V power and I/O  
- 2.5mA max current use during conversion (while requesting data)  
- Good for 0-100% humidity readings with 2-5% accuracy  
- Good for -40 to 80°C temperature readings ±0.5°C accuracy  
- No more than 0.5 Hz sampling rate (once every 2 seconds)  

- Single-bus data is used for communication between MCU and DHT22, it costs 5mS for single time
communication.
